This is a simple code that uses the ESP32 and an accelerometer to turn on a light depending on where the sensor sees it being turned...

The pins to which you have to connect the LEDs are: X axis: 4, 17 and Y axis: 5, 16.
Then the accelerometer pins are GPIO21 and GPIO22 (pin 21 is SDA and 22 is SCL).
Here you can see the pins of the ESP32, some may vary...
